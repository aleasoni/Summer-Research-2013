Summer-Research-2013
====================

05-21-2013:
Meeting with Dongwon and Mike

- Revisit Machine Learning final project code. Changes to be done:
    -> rewrite code in python
    -> include parameters: kmer length, min and max distance between kmer pair

- Once done generate feature vectors and test svm_light ~ auROC.

- Also get Guan's code for Markov Chains, and see how much of it you can use:
    -> set up Markov chains and test ~ auROC
